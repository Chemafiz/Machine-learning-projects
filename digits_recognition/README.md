### An attempt to train a classical (without neural networks) machine learning model for recognizing numbers using MNIST dataset.

Done:  
- trained model and simple evaluation  

In the future:
- a small app to recognize the numbers entered by the user in real time (work in progress)
- training the model with the artificial neural networks (I have to learn it :) )
